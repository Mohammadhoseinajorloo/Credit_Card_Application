## Project Name & Pitch

Credit_Card_Applications

In this project, using the SOM algorithm, we want to pull out the custom ideas that do not behave reasonably, and after a complete review, we will do statistical work on these customers and reach their account :)

## Project Status

This project was originally created to test small slills:
... - clean coding
... - correct commenting in the code
... - implementation of a code in the field of unsupervised deep learning algorithms.
The implemented code is basically **OOP(OBJECT ORIENTED PROGGRAMMING)** and is a sample code in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/abhikalpsrivastava15/dl-a-z-som-fraud-detector/comments).
I will ve glad to cooperate with in this work.
Be sure to comment your opinions and criticisms so that i can learn more from you :)
